=== NeuVector Integration into CI/CD Workflow

NeuVector supports the entire CI/CD process and can be easily integrated into the workflow to provide security throughout the development and deployment process.

==== Dev and Continuous Integration Workflow

NeuVector can be integrated into the Dev and CI processes to automate vulnerability scanning. The use of the NeuVector Jenkins plug-in and Registry scanning functions enable image scanning during this phase.

In addition, NeuVector can be used during automated application testing to analyze network connections and container behavior to anticipate any issues in staging or production.

==== Continuous Deployment and Production Workflow

NeuVector can conduct pre-deployment compliance testing and security auditing prior to production as well as in production.

The multi-vector security platform is able to combine network security, container inspections, and host security to protect containers at run-time.
