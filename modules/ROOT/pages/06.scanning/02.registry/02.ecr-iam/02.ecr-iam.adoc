=== AWS ECR - IAM Roles

When the NeuVector containers are deployed in AWS, and an EC2 instance is assigned a role of "`EC2 Container Registry`" Read Access, the AWS ECR registry can be scanned without an Access Key and Secret Key.

Here is how to create an AWS role and assign it to the node.

==== Select the Instance

Note that the IAM role is either blank or does not include the ECR role
