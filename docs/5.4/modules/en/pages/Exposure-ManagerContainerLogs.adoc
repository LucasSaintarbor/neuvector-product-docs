[NOTE]
====
NeuVector installations that do not use Rancher SSO or Remote Repository Configuration are *not affected* by this issue.
====

In the patched version, the `X-R-Sess` value is partially masked for safety. Other fields such as `personal_access_token`, `token`, `rekor_public_key`, `root_cert`, `sct_public_key`, and `public_key` are no longer logged, as request body logging was removed.

[NOTE]
====
* The severity of this vulnerability depends on your logging strategy:
  ** *Local logging (default):* Limits impact exposure.
  ** *External logging:* Increases risk, depending on your external log collector's security posture.
* Impact severity may also depend on the permissions of the exposed credentials.

== Patches

Patched versions include `5.4.5` and above. Users should rotate any GitHub token used in Remote Repository Configuration after upgrading.

== Workarounds

No workarounds are currently available. Upgrade to the fixed version as soon as possible.
