In the UI Extension in the Rancher portal, the **NeuVector Dashboard** works similarly to its standalone page. It provides security risk score factors to let users know the security status of their clusters. In the bottom panel, it provides 4 tabs to let users switch the charts to monitor different categories.

In the **Security Events** tab, the line chart shows a date-based event count in a timeline. The top Security Events bar chart displays the top 5 source and destination endpoints.

In the **Ingress and Egress Exposure** tab, the stacked bar chart shows the amount of exposed endpoints by actions. On the right side, the exposure tables show egress and ingress endpoint services with scan information.

Clicking on a row of the egress/ingress table shows conversations on specific services. The FQDN name / IP address is shown with a geography location based national flag in the **External Host** field.

Clicking on the **External Host** redirects to whois.com to show the IP address' detailed information.

In the **Policy Mode** tab, the pie charts show the ratio and numbers of pods / services under different policy modes.
