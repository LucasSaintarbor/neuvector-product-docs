== Integrating with IBM Security Advisor

{product-name} Integrates with IBM Security Advisor on IBM Cloud.

To generate the registration URL required, please log into the {product-name} console as an administrator and go to Settings -> Configuration.

. Enable "Integrate with IBM Security Advisor" -> Submit
. Click "Get URL" -> Copy to clipboard

Then return to the IBM Security Advisor console, and under "Enter the {product-name} setup URL", type in "https://{{product-name} controller hostname/ip}:\{port}" and paste what is copied in from the steps above. For the port, use the exposed {product-name} REST API port (default is 10443). For multi-cluster environments this is also the 'fed-worker' service which exposes this port.

IBM Security Advisor will communicate with your {product-name} cluster controller thru the provided hostname or IP. Note: This may need to be exposed as a service for access from outside the Kubernetes cluster, similar to how the REST API is exposed as a service.

=== Verifying the Connection

When the connection is successfully created between IBM Security Advisor & {product-name}, you will see the green "Connected at {date, time}" icon next to "Integrate with IBM Security Advisor" in the {product-name} Console.
