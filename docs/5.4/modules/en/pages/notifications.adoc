== Security Events

In the UI Extension on the Rancher portal, the **Security Events** tab works similarly to the NeuVector standalone page. The events can be triggered by several factors:

* Dangerous conversation or data transportation from somewhere to the endpoint (Node or pod).
* End-to-end violated connection against network policy.
* Violated operation against process profile rule.
* Violated operation against file access rule.

Open the **Advanced Filter** side panel, and you will find multiple options supporting your search:

* Severity, Location and Category can be filtered according to the tags on the right side of the event title.
* The autocomplete list supports user entries for Host, Source, and Destination fields and supports a multiple tag-input box for Namespace.
