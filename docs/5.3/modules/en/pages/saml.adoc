After the user is authenticated, the proper role can be derived with group-based role mapping configuration. To setup group-based role mapping,

. If group-based role mapping is not configured or the matched groups cannot be located, the authenticated user will be assigned with the Default role. If the Default role is set to None, when group-based role mapping fails, the user is not able to login.
