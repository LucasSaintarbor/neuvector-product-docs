== Scan for Vulnerabilities in the CircleCI Build Pipeline

The {product-name} CircleCI ORB triggers a vulnerability scan on an image in the CircleCI pipeline. The ORB is available in the https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/neuvector/neuvector-orb[CircleCI catalog] and is also documented on the https://github.com/neuvector/circleci-orb[{product-name} GitHub page].

Deploy the {product-name} Allinone or Controller container if you haven't already done so on a host reachable by the CircleCI ORB. Make a note of the IP address of the host where the Allinone or Controller is running.

The ORB supports two use cases:

. Triggering the scan to be performed outside the CirclCI infrastructure. The ORB contacts the {product-name} scanner, which then pulls the image from a registry to be scanned. Make sure the ORB has network connectivity to the host where the {product-name} Controller/Allinone is running.
. Dynamically launching a {product-name} controller and scanner on a temporary vm running on the CircleCI platform. After launching and auto-configuring, the scan be done on image in the build, and after completion the {product-name} deployment is stopped and removed.  For this use case, please see the documentation on the https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/neuvector/neuvector-orb[CircleCI ORB for {product-name}].

In addition, make sure there is a {product-name} scanner container deployed and configured to connect to the Allinone or Controller. In 4.0 and later, the neuvector/scanner container must be deployed separate from the allinone or controller.

Add the {product-name} orb to Your Build config.yaml

The registry_url is the location to find the image to be scanned. Configure the repository name, tag, and if a layered scan should be performed. Add criteria for the build task to fail based on number of high or medium vulnerabilities detected.

=== Review the Results

The build task will pass or fail based on the criteria set. In either case you can review the full scan report.
